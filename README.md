# Audio_In_Out_Init_STM32F7

This Project was made to be used as a template to initialize the STM32F767ZI Microcontroller without the need/use of the STM Hal Libraries. In conjuction, The Project is intended to be used in combination with other audio processing code without the need to spend hours on initializing peripherals but still working at a more barebones level. Feel free to use for your but keep in mind that modification (major or minor) may be needed when working with other processors.
